  <h2>History & Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Staten Island, originally called <strong>Richmond</strong>, is the least populated 
    borough of New York City but one of the most historic. It was first settled by the 
    Dutch in the 1600s and later became a key gateway for immigrants arriving in America.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike the fast pace of Manhattan, Staten Island is known for its quiet neighborhoods,
    waterfront views, and strong community culture. It blends suburban calm with 
    city identity.
