<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>About Staten Island</h2>
  <p>
    Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City, often called the
    most overlooked — yet it is one of the most unique. Known for its waterfront
    views, green spaces, historic neighborhoods, and strong sense of community,
    Staten Island offers a slower, more reflective side of NYC.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is home to beaches, forests, historic towns, and panoramic views of the
    Manhattan skyline. Unlike the crowded streets of Manhattan, Staten Island
    blends urban life with nature, giving it a peaceful yet powerful character.

<!-- HISTORY -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Staten Island has a rich and complex history dating back to Indigenous Lenape
    tribes, followed by Dutch and British settlement. It officially became part
    of New York City in 1898.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, Staten Island was shaped by shipping, manufacturing, and
    immigration. Many families who settled here built tight-knit communities that
    still exist today. The borough played an important role in maritime trade and
    defense throughout American history.
